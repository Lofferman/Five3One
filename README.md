## Overview

As a hobbyist powerlifter with over a decade of lifting experience—and the last three years focused specifically on powerlifting—I’ve come to appreciate the importance of **technique and form over simply chasing heavier weights**.

One thing that consistently frustrated me, though, was the mental math involved in preparing the bar for my lifts. Calculating plate requirements—especially when following the **5/3/1 program**—was always a hassle. I wanted to conserve mental energy for the lifts themselves, not spend it doing calculations.

So, I built a solution.

Over the past year, I’ve developed and refined an application designed to **streamline the 5/3/1 experience** and eliminate distractions caused by figuring out working weights and plate loading. The result is a tool that allows me to stay focused on technique and execution during every workout.

## What Is the 5/3/1 Method?

The **5/3/1 program**, created by Jim Wendler, is a popular and proven strength-training methodology built around steady, long-term progress.

It focuses on four primary compound lifts:

- Squat
- Bench Press
- Deadlift
- Overhead Press

The program runs in four-week cycles, alternating intensity to promote recovery and consistent strength gains.

### Weekly Structure

- **Week 1**
  - 3 sets of 5 reps at **65% / 75% / 85%** of your training max

- **Week 2**
  - 3 sets of 3 reps at **70% / 80% / 90%** of your training max

- **Week 3**
  - 3 sets of **5 / 3 / 1** reps at **75% / 85% / 95%** of your training max

- **Week 4**
  - **Deload week**, using lighter weights to recover and reset

While the system is incredibly effective, it also requires frequent calculations: training maxes, working percentages, and plate breakdowns. This application removes that friction entirely.

## Key Features

### 1. Squat, Bench, Deadlift, and Overhead Press Modules

The core of the app consists of four dedicated modules—one for each main lift.

You enter your **training max (1RM)**, and the app automatically calculates all required sets using the 5/3/1 methodology:

- **5/5/5+**
- **3/3/3+**
- **5/3/1+**
- **Deload**

For each set, the app provides:

- Target weight
- Rep scheme
- **Exact plate breakdown per side of the bar**

No mental math. No switching between apps. Just load the bar and lift.

### 2. Plate Calculator

Not every workout follows the 5/3/1 structure. Sometimes you just need to know:

> *“How many plates do I load for this weight?”*

The **Plate Calculator** allows you to input any target weight and instantly see the required plate configuration per side of the barbell.

This works whether you’re running a 5/3/1 cycle or doing custom training.

---

### 3. Settings & Customization

The app is designed to adapt to *your* lifting preferences.

#### Rounding Strategy

Choose how weights are rounded:

- **Up** – Round up to the nearest available weight
- **Nearest** – Round to the closest available weight
- **Down** – Round down for conservative loading

#### Precision

Control how granular the weight calculations are:

- 2.5 lbs
- 5.0 lbs
- 10.0 lbs

#### Training Max Percentage

Select how your training max is derived from your true 1RM:

- **90%** – Conservative and sustainable
- **95%** – Balanced progression
- **100%** – Full intensity

---

## Progressive Improvement

> *Work is never done, and learning is never complete.*

Planned future improvements include:

### Custom Modules
Add additional lifts and track them using the same calculation logic.

### Quick Weight Adjustments
Incremental controls for adjusting max lifts directly within each module:

- ± 2.5 lbs
- ± 5.0 lbs

### Export Functionality
Export training data for long-term tracking and backup. Many lifters maintain historical records in Excel, and this feature will allow seamless integration.

## Conclusion

As a powerlifter who prioritizes **technique over mental math**, this application has been a game-changer.

By automating calculations for working weights, rep schemes, and plate loading, the app lets you focus entirely on what matters most—**lifting well and getting stronger**.

Whether you’re strictly following 5/3/1 or building your own routine, this tool removes friction and keeps your attention where it belongs.
